What is Capitall? This application allows the user to keep track of their financial accounts, transactions, budgets, saving goals, and bills to achieve their financial goals. 

In this application, a user will be able to:

Add transactions that are coming from or into their accounts. Add financial accounts that will calculate their net worth. A user is able to set monthly budgets that new transaction may affect if the spending is associated with a particular budget. They are also able to set saving goals such as vacations. Last but not least, the user may add their reoccuring bills to keep track when they are due.
